    <p>I Like the Clash, the Red Hots and Tom Waits. I like the idea of city living, but I'm chillin' in the woods.</p>
    <p>As you can tell, this is my first attempt at a web page. I built the server too!</p>
    <p>I am currently not working as I'm recovering from a protracted illness. At the moment I like to think of myself as funemployed! So as I'd really like to get into this web dev game, I thought I'd take this golden oppertunity to learn about it.</p>
    <p>I'm Dyslexic, which can make for some interesting SMS messages, it also makes web coding doubly hard&hellip;</p>
